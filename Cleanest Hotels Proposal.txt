Capstone 3 Proposal:

When users create reviews on Yelp there are multiple factors that go into their ranking. People priortize different factors. Whether the hotel is close to restaurants/shopping, does it have breakfast, does it have a restaurant, how far it is from the airport.

In this project we will sort through the user reviews and use natural language processing to find the highest ranked hotels that prioritize cleanliness in their reviews.
